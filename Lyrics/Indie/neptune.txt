Pitch black, pale blue
It was a stained glass
variation of the truth
and I felt empty handed
You let me set sail
with cheap wood
so I patched up
every leak that I could
’til the blame grew too heavy
Stitch by stitch I tear apart
If brokenness is a form of art
I must be a poster child prodigy
Thread by thread I come apart
If brokenness is a work of art
surely this must be my masterpiece
I’m only honest when it rains
If I time it right, the thunder breaks
when I open my mouth
I want to tell you but I don’t know how
I’m only honest when it rains
an open book with a torn out page
and my ink’s run out
I want to love you but I don’t know how
I don’t know how
no I don’t know how
I don’t know how.
I want to love you but I don’t know how
I want to love you
Pitch black, pale blue
these wild oceans
shake what’s left of me loose
just to hear me cry mercy
A strong wind at my back
so I lift up the only sail that I have
this tired white flag
I’m only honest when it rains
If I time it right, the thunder breaks
when I open my mouth
I want to tell you but I don’t know how
I’m only honest when it rains
an open book with a torn out page
and my ink’s run out
I want to love you but I don’t know how
I don’t know how, know how, know how
I want to love you but I don’t know how
I want to love you
