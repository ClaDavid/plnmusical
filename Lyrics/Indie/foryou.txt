If I talk real slowly
If I try real hard
To make my point dear,
That you have my heart.
Here I go
I'll tell you,
what you already know.
Here I go.
I'll tell you,
what you already know.
If you love me, with all of your heart.
If you love me, I'll make you a star in my universe.
you'll never have to go to work.
you'll spend everyday, shining your light my way.
If I talk real slowly
If I hold your hand
If you look real closely my love,
you might understand.
Here I go
I'll tell you,
what you already know.
Here I go.
I'll tell you,
what you already know.
If you love me, with all that you are.
If you love me I'll make you a star in my universe
you'll never have to go to work.
you'll spend everyday, shining your light my way.
Here I go
I'll tell you,
what you already know.
Here I go.
I'll tell you,
what you already know.
If you love me, with all of your heart.
If you love me, I'll make you a star in my universe.
you'll never have to go to work.
you'll spend everyday, shining your light my way.
