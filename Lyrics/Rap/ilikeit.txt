Now I like dollars, I like diamonds
I like stunting, I like shining
I like million dollar deals
Where's my pen, bitch I'm signin'
I like those Balenciagas
The ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler
I put rocks all in my watch
I like texts from my exes
When they want a second chance
I like proving niggas wrong
I do what they say I can't
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body
Spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali
Fur coat, Ferrari
Hop out the stu, jump in the coupe (the coupe)
They trippin' on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry, though
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario)
Yeah they call me Cardi B
I run this shit like cardio
Oh, damn
