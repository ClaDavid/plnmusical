She was sitting all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swinging by a georgia plate
I was looking for her boyfriend
Thinking, no way she ain't got one
Soon as I sat down I was falling in love
Trying to pour a little sugar in her dixie cup
Talking over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off
She was like, oh, my God, this is my song
I've been listening to the radio all night long
Sitting round waiting for it to come on and here it is
She was like, come here, boy, I wanna dance
Before I said a word, she was taking my hand
Spinning me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again
And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again
I'd have gave that dj my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sitting in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scanning like a fool am, fm, xm too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up
She was like, oh, my God, this is my song
We've been listening to the radio all night long
I can't believe it came back on, but here it is
She was like, come here, boy, I wanna dance
Before I said a word, she was taking my hand
Spinning in the headlights, she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again
And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again
The next friday night we were sitting out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I brought out my guitar
She was like, oh, my God, this is my song
I've been listening to the radio all night long
Sitting 'round, waiting for it to come on and here it is
She was like, come here, boy, I wanna dance
Before I said a word, she was taking my hand
Spinning me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, play it again, play it again, play it again
And I said, play it again, play it again, play it again
Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again
