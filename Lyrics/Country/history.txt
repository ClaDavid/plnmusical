Don't move 
Baby Don't move
I just want to take this all in 
The moonlight dancing off your skin
Our time. Lets take our time
I just want to look in your eyes and catch our breath
Cuz I just got this feeling
This could be one of those memories
We want to hold on to, cling to, one we can't forget
Baby, this could be our last first kiss
The thought of forever
What if this was that moment
That chance worth taking
History in the making
Inside, baby inside
Can't you feel the butterflies? 
Floating all around
Cuz I can sure feel them now
Tonight, maybe tonight
Is a start of a beautiful ride that will never end
And baby I've got a feeling
This could be one of those memories
We want to hold on to, cling to, one we can't forget
Baby, this could be our last first kiss
The thought of forever
What if this was that moment
That chance worth taking
History in the making
Right here, right now
Holding you in my arms
This could be one of those memories
We want to hold on to, cling to, one we can't forget
Baby, this could be our last first kiss
The thought of forever
What if this was that moment
That chance worth taking
History in the making
