I'm sorry, but I'm just a girl
Not usually the kind to show my heart to the world
I'm pretty good at keeping it together
I hold my composure, for worse or for better
So I apologize if you don't like what you see
But sometimes my emotions get the best of me
And falling apart is as human as it gets
You can't hide it, you can't fight what the truth is
You can pretty lie
And say it's okay
You can pretty smile
And just walk away
Pretty much fake your way
Through anything
But you can't cry pretty
Oh no, you canâ€™t dress it up in lace or rhinestones
Don't matter if you're in a crowd or home all alone
Yeah, it's all the same when you're looking in the mirror
A pinch or a pain, so let it flow like a river
You can pretty lie
And say it's okay
You can pretty smile
And just walk away
Pretty much fake your way
Through anything
But you can't cry pretty
You can't turn off the flood
When the dam breaks
When all your mascara
Is going to waste
When things get ugly
You just got to face
That you can't cry pretty
Oh, no, you can't
Uuh, yeah!
You can't turn off the flood
When the dam breaks
When all your mascara
Is going to waste
When things get ugly
You just got to face
That you can't cry pretty
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No, you can't cry
No, you can't cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, woo!
You can't cry
You can't cry pretty, baby
Oh, yeah!
No, you can't cry pretty, yeah
