For too long now, there were secrets in my mind
For too long now, there were things I should've said
In the darkness, I was stumbling for the door
To find a reason, to find the time, the place, the hour
Waiting for the winter sun and the cold light of day
The misty ghost of childhood fears
The pressure is building, and I can't stay away
I throw myself into the sea
Release the wave
Let it wash over me
To face the fear, I once believed
The tears of the dragon for you and for me
Where I was, I had wings that couldn't fly
Where I was, I had tears I couldn't cry
My emotions, frozen in an icy lake
I couldn't feel them until the ice began to break
I have no power over this, you know I'm afraid
The walls I built are crumbling, the water is moving
I'm slipping away
I throw myself into the sea
Release the wave
Let it wash over me
To face the fear, I once believed
The tears of the dragon for you and for me
Slowly, I awake
Slowly, I rise
The walls I built are crumbling
The water is moving
I'm slipping away
I throw myself into the sea
Release the wave
Let it wash over me
To face the fear, I once believed
The tears of the dragon for you and for me
I throw myself into the sea
Release the wave
Let it wash over me
To face the fear, I once believed
The tears of the dragon for you and for me
