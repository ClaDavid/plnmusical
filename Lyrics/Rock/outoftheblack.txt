How did it feel when it came alive and took you?
Out of the black
It broke your skin and shook through
Every part of me, every part of you
You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running
So don’t breathe when I talk
Cos you haven’t been spoken to
I’ve got a gun for a mouth
And a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart
Beating blood from an empty pocket
I never knew why
And you didn’t care when
It closed every door
And washed away no sin
And I promised you
Like you promised me
But those vows we made
Fucked it up for free
Yeah!
You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running
So don’t breathe when I talk
Cos you haven’t been spoken to
I’ve got a gun for a mouth
And a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart
Bleeding blood from an empty pocket
You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running
So don’t breathe when I talk
Cos you haven’t been spoken to
I’ve got a gun for a mouth
And a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart
Bleeding blood from an empty pocket
And it tortures slow
Never let you go
Deals a crooked hand
