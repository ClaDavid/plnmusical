Who's been working so damn hard
You got that head on overload?
Got yourself this flawless body
Aching now from head to toe
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
All my ladies 'round the world
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Good girls better get bad
You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go
Destiny said it: You got to get up and get it
Get mad independent and don't you ever forget it
Got some dirt on your shoulder, then let me brush it off for ya
If you're feeling me, put your five high
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
Get up, what you waiting for?
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
Nod if you been played by every boo
Just tryna show you off
Thought he was the best you ever had
Until he cut you off
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Bet, you bet, you know your worth
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Good girls better get bad
You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go
Destiny said it: You got to get up and get it
Get mad independent and don't you ever forget it
Got some dirt on your shoulder, then let me brush it off for ya
If you're feeling me, put your five high
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
What you wait, what you wait
What you waiting for?
That's my girl
That's my girl
That's my girl
You've been down before
You've been hurt before
You got up before
You'll be good to go, good to go
(Don't ever give up, no, no)
Destiny said it: You got to get up and get it
Get mad independent and don't you ever forget it
Got some dirt on your shoulder, then let me brush it off for ya

Ain't nothing, ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Put your heart and your soul in it
Ain't nothing, ain't nothing, ain't nothing
Put your heart and your soul in it
