Oh no, here we go again
Fighting over what I said
I'm sorry
Yeah, I’m sorry
Bad at love, no, I'm not good at this
But I can't say I’m innocent
Not hardly
But I'm sorry
And all my friends, they know and it's true
I don't know who I am without you
I got it bad, baby
Got it bad
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone on days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone on days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, can you hear my heart say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
No, you ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
And I hope I never see the day
That you move on and be happy
Without me
Without me
What’s my hand without your heart to hold?
I don’t know what I'm living for
If I’m living
Without you
All my friends, they know and it's true
I don't know who I am without you
I've got it bad, baby
I got it bad
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone on days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, tell me you love me
I need someone on days like this, I do
On days like this
Oh, can you hear my heart say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You ain’t nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
My heart's like
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
No, you ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
You ain't nobody 'til you got somebody
Everything I need
Is standing in front of me
I know that we will be alright, alright, yeah
Through the ups and downs
Baby, I'ma stick around
I promise we will be alright, alright
Oh, tell me you love me

On days like this
