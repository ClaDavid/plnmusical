She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look you
She hides true love,  en su bolsillo
Shes got a halo around her finger, around you
You know that I love you boy, hot like Mexico, rejoice
At this point I gotta choose nothing to loose   
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro  
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando 
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch, just smoke one cigarette   
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto   
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-ale-jandro, Ale-ale-jandro   
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-ale-jandro, Ale-ale-jandro
Just stop. please, just let me go. Alejandro, just let me go           
She's not broken, she's just a baby        
But her boyfriend's like a dad, just like a dad
Draw those flames that, burn before him    
Now he's gonna find fly a kite, gonna fool you bad  
Don't bother me, don't bother me, Alejandro   
Don't call my name, don't call my name, bye Fernando  
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Alejandro 
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch, Fernando   
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro  
I'm not your babe,  I'm not your babe, Fernando 
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch, just smoke one cigarette   
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto   
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-ale-jandro, Ale-ale-jandro   
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-ale-jandro, Ale-ale-jandro   
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-ale-jandro, Ale-ale-jandro   
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-ale-jandro, Ale-ale-jandro
