Ohh woaah, Ohh woaah, Ohh woaah, Ohh woaah
You know you love me,I know you care
You shout whenever, And I'll be there
You want my love, You want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl quit playing
We're just friends, What are you saying?
Said there's another, Lok right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time,
And I was like
Baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I thought you'd always be mine mine
Baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I thought you'd always be mine, oh oh
For you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we're here together
And I gotta play it col, 'cause I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
'Cause I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And you shake me 'til you wakeï»¿ me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around,
And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby no
I'm like baby, baby, baby no 
I thought you'd always be mine mine
Baby, baby, baby no

I thought you'd always be mine, mine
You can give all of your love,
But sometimes it won't be enough
Never told me this day would come,
Now I'm all gone
You can give all your love,
But sometimes it won't be enough
Never told me this day would come
'Cause I was like
Baby, baby, baby no

I thought you'd always be mine mine
