Take a seat
Right over there
Sat on the stairs
Stay or leave
The cabinets are bare
And I'm unaware
Of just how we got
Into this mess
Got so aggressive
I know we meant
All good intentions
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go
Oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Take a step
Back for a minute
Into the kitchen
Floors are wet
And taps are still running
Dishes are broken
How did we get
Into this mess?
Got so aggressive
I know we meant
All good intentions
So pull me closer
Why don't you pull me close?
Why don't you come on over?
I can't just let you go
Oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle
Looking at you I can't lie
Just pouring out admission
Regardless my objection, oh oh
And it's not about my pride
I need you on my skin just
Come over, pull me in just
Oh baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
In the middle, no no
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle? Oh yeah
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle? Oh
In the middle
Baby
Why don't you just meet me in the middle, baby?
I'm losing my mind just a little
So why don't you just meet me in the middle, middle?
In the middle, middle
